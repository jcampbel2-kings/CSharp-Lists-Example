# CSharp-Lists-Example
Example code for Lists and Linked lists (using a class element)

There are 3 code files  
- Program.cs contains the class def of **Student** and the Main subroutine.  This has a simple menu option to use Lists or LinkedLists to store student data  
- ListExample.cs creates a LIST of student and allows simple add/find/list  
- LinkExample.cs is equivilent but uses a Linked List instead of a List
